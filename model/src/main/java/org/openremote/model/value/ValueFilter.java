/**
 * Interface for a filter that can be applied to messages of type &lt;T&gt; the filter can return a different
 * value type to the supplied message (i.e. value conversion as well as filtering). Filters can be chained and
 * filters should be applied using the following logic:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If message is null then do not pass through filter</li>
 * <li>If message type doesn't match the filter's message type then treat as if filter returned null</li>
 * <li>If filter throws an exception then handle and treat as if filter returned null</li>
